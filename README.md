Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a Front-End Developer and BCA student with a focus on UI/UX design and data analysis.

Overview
This is a single-page portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive design, smooth scrolling, and a mobile-friendly navigation menu. The website highlights my skills, provides an "About Me" section, and includes contact information with links to my social media profiles.

Features
Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using media queries.
Mobile Menu Toggle: A hamburger menu that expands/collapses on mobile screens (≤768px).
Smooth Scrolling: Anchor links scroll smoothly to their respective sections.
Interactive UI: Hover effects on buttons, skill cards, and social links for better user engagement.
Custom Styling: Uses CSS variables for consistent theming (e.g., --primary-color, --secondary-color).
Font Awesome Icons: Integrated for visual enhancement of skills and social links.
Cloudflare Email Protection: Email address is obfuscated to prevent spam.
Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the webpage.
CSS3: Styling with custom properties, grid, flexbox, and media queries.
JavaScript: Dynamic functionality like menu toggling and smooth scrolling.
Font Awesome: Icons for skills and social media links.
Cloudflare: Email protection and additional scripts for security.
